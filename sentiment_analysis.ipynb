He would ignore requests to remove such posts when vetted on the subject by department heads.

While his work may seem beneficial to those in need, a majority of the people who actually showed up to these events from his advertisements are not dealing with food insecurities.\\n\\nCampolargo is currently facing conduct probation and removal from campus housing.\\n\\nTo make this story even crazier, Elon Musk is trying to sue the university in Campolargo's defense. Elon Musk is arguing that Juan has had his First Amendment rights violated by the University based on these sanctions, but I don't believe Musk's lawyers have a good chance here. What Campolargo is doing here is borderline aiding and abetting; encouraging people to commit food theft and acting negligible to the consequences.
