For what I got with the upgrades I purchased I feel that what I got was about a $500 value and we spent almost $700.

But it\\'s called Lover\\'s Playground now, at 872 N State.  Nearly 3 decades later and it\\'s still a porn shop, that is crazy lol.  \\n\\nWe went too far down Chicago Ave., and turned into a parking lot to turn around.  It was pitch black, but the headlights illuminated the fact that there were LOT of people in the parking lot, at least a hundred I\\'d say, all kinda gathered around this tiny little house.  To this day I have no idea what they were doing or why there were so many people there.  It was very surreal.  \\n\\nWe realized that we were in the infamous Cabrini Green and knew we should leave ASAP.  Right as we were exiting the parking lot the cops pounced on us.  I had a bowl and some weed on me.  I stuck the bowl under the passenger seat but didn\\'t have time to do anything with the weed, because right then the door ripped open and the biggest cop I\\'ve ever seen pulls me out of the car by my throat and yells \"Where\\'s the fucking crack?\" in my face.  I tell him I have no idea what he\\'s talking about.  \\n\\nThe other cop is older and looks like he\\'s sick of the big dudes shit, he chills and talks with us while his partner tore the car to pieces.  Ripped out the damn seats and kept telling us how fucked we were - after he found out my friend and he went to the same grade school he pointed as us and \"Now you\\'re twice as fucked!\"  Really dude...  Searched my friend, searched me and even checked my crotch and made me take off my sandals... but not my pockets.  Finally, exasperated, he says, \"So you guys didn\\'t come down here to buy drugs?\". We said no, we\\'re in college, if we wanted drugs we would just ask a neighbor (omitting the fact that we were there to buy legal whippets).  By then a crowd had gathered, and they (not kidding) all cheered when the cops were forced to let us go.  I remember a lady walking really close to us and looking at the cops and saying, \"Good for you, you go ahead and let these white boys go home now\" lmao (I am white but my friend is 100% Mexican lol, whatever).    \\n\\nFor some reason, the roided-out cop never found the bowl under the seat or the weed in my pocket.  He checked every last spot but those two places, and I mean he really tore that car up, the back seats were never really the same after that (was an awesome old Oldsmobile with one of those huge couch seats in the back - he tore that whole thing out!).  Never checked under the passenger seat, or my pockets, though.  Literally everywhere else. \\n Amazing.  \\n\\nWhen we were about to leave, I said wait and jumped out, ran back to the cop car, and asked them if they knew where Frenchie\\'s was. They actually gave us directions lol, and after all that we scored the whippets and went back to our dorm, still in total shock.  Good times.\\n\\nEdit: I typed this on my phone earlier, fixed some typos/details when I got to my desk.  \\n\\nEdit2: For anyone who doesn\\'t know what whippets are, it\\'s nitrous oxide (also called hippy crack), same stuff you get at the dentist sometimes.  Ever been to frat party or a rave and wonder why there\\'s a bunch of people sucking on balloons?  Porn shops used to carry crackers and cartridges when it was still legal to sell them straight up like that.  Frenchie\\'s was funny in that they had a big basket of free balloons for you to grab a few handfuls on the way out.  Those cartridges are still used in coffee shops everywhere to make fresh whipped cream.  Around the same time as the Cabrini incident I was working for a coffee shop and even the managers were doing whippets - I remember telling one of them that had just been doing them that we were almost out of the cartridges and she said \"Well, we\\'ll order more!\"  and like doubled the order.  She also ordered lots of extra cannisters too (restaurant quality, not cheap), we all took them home and decorated them so we\\'d know which was whose at parties.  Mine was covered with stenciled electric tape, I wonder whatever happened to that thing.  Did you know that if you don\\'t put any cream in there, you can fit two entire cartridges?  Btw, I DO NOT recommend doing any of that.  That stuff is honestly really bad for you.  \\n\\nEdit3: I know this is way too long already but one thing I wanted to add... It\\'s POSSIBLE that the cop, when he heard that my friend and he went to the same school (and also found out that my friend has a few cop relatives and was working as a security guard himself at the time), secretly decided to let us go and actually had seen the bowl under the passenger seat - it would explain how the hell he missed it.  He definitely did not check my pockets that had the bag though, and if he was acting, then man... he put on a hell of show for us and that crowd.', 'People drinking $10 coffee who live there now don’t even have a clue that Cabrini green was ever  there or all the horrors that occurred there.', 'Hi!
